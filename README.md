## 🔹 Overview

Inefficient CI/CD workflows lead to **high cloud costs, increased carbon emissions, and slow deployments**. Our **AI-driven GitHub Workflow Optimizer** automatically detects inefficiencies, reduces CPU/GPU usage, and **optimizes resource consumption—saving time, money, and the environment**.
